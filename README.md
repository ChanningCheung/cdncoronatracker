# Canadian Coronavirus Tracker v1.0.0 | Channing Cheung

## Objectives:
- Entry to the ENCMP 100 Programming Contest (Fall 2020)
- Educate & inform Canadians using accurate real time data
- Develop and grow my coding knowledge with MATLAB

## Introduction:
This project started when I was a first year engineering student at the University of Alberta. In one of these courses, ENCMP 100 (Computer Programming for Engineers
), there was an optional programming contest. While developing this program for that contest, I gained more experience with MATLAB and project management. I will try and develop features listed on the roadmap when I am free from other obligations.

##### Active Cases Timeline
- Graph displays all active cases 
##### Total Deaths: Regional Breakdown
- Graph displays a regional breakdown confirmed deaths 
##### New Deaths: Regional Breakdown
- Graph displays a regional breakdown of the daily change in confirmed deaths
##### Recovered Cases Timeline
- Graph displays all recovered cases
##### Daily Change in Recovered Cases Timeline
- Graph displays the daily change in recovered cases
##### Total Tests Distributed Timeline
- Graph displays all tests done
##### Daily Change in Tests Distributed Timeline
- Graph displays the daily change in tests
##### World Case Comparison
- Pie Chart compares Canada's total cases with the top 5 countries and the rest of the world
- Also displays the total world cases
##### World Death Comparison
- Pie Chart compares Canada's total deaths with the top 5 countries and the rest of the world
- Also displays the total world deaths
##### Open README.txt

## Instructions:
1) Download files from this repository.
2) Move these files into the MATLAB directory. For most users, this will be in C:\users\USERNAME\Documents\MATLAB . 
3) Open the cdn_covid_tracker_vx_x_x.m file in MATLAB (version 2020A or later).
4) When you first run the program, a menu will pop up. Select an option to view that data.
5) For the graphs, you can choose to view the data as a trendline or use the MATLAB figure window to pinpoint specific dates.
6) You can click on other options to view more data or click End Program.
